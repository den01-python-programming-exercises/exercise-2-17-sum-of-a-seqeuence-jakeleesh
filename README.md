# Exercise 2.17 Sum of a sequence

Implement a program, which calculates the sum 1+2+3+...+n where n is given as user input.

Sample output:

```plaintext
Last number? **3**
The sum is 6
```

The previous example calculated 1 + 2 + 3  = 6

```plaintext
Last number? **7**
The sum is 28
```

And this one calculated 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28
